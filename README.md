## CSES Problem Set Solutions (C++)

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the CSES Problem Set ([https://cses.fi/](https://cses.fi/)). Each section of the problem set has its own directory, and the solutions are written in C++.

### Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── README.md (This file)
├── Introductory Problems
│   ├── ... (Solution files for Introductory Problems)
│   └── ...
├── Sorting and Searching
│   ├── ... (Solution files for Sorting and Searching)
│   └── ...
└── ... (Directories for other problem sections)
```

Each solution file is named according to the problem name (e.g., `WeirdAlgorithm.cpp`).

### Usage

This repository serves as a personal record of your problem-solving journey and may not be directly executable. Here's a general approach to using these solutions:

1. **Access the CSES Problem Set:** Visit [https://cses.fi/](https://cses.fi/) to explore the problems.
2. **Choose a problem:** Select a problem from a specific section and understand its requirements.
3. **Review the solution (optional):** You can review the provided solution code in the corresponding directory here to understand different approaches.
4. **Implement your own solution:** Write your own C++ code to solve the problem based on your understanding.
5. **Test and refine:** Test your code with the provided test cases on the CSES platform and refine your solution as needed.

**Note:** While reviewing existing solutions can be helpful, strive to develop your own problem-solving skills and approach each problem with a fresh perspective.
